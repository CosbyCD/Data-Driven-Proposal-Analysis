/*
File: data_quality_summary_report.sql

This SQL query generates a comprehensive summary report 
for the "combined_data" table, focusing on data quality 
assessment. The query calculates the count of NULL and 
empty values for each column, along with the total record 
count, and presents the results in a structured format. 
By utilizing conditional expressions and filters, the 
query provides valuable insights into the presence of 
missing or inconsistent data across multiple columns. 
The report aids in identifying potential data quality 
issues, enabling effective data cleansing and enhancement 
efforts.
