GAC_Cyclistic_project

Project Overview
Introducing the GAC_Cyclistic_project â€“ a dedicated initiative focused on enhancing Cyclistic's
marketing strategies to engage casual riders and encourage their transition into annual members.
Cyclistic, a prominent bike share program in Chicago, boasts a robust fleet of 5,824 bikes 
stationed across 692 convenient docking points. With an array of bike categories, styles,
and flexible pricing plans, Cyclistic caters to a diverse spectrum of riders, ranging from
leisurely cyclists to daily commuters.

This endeavor seeks to gain comprehensive insights into the behaviors of both annual members
and casual riders. These invaluable observations will guide our strategic marketing endeavors.
Leveraging the analysis of extensive historical bike trip data and employing tools like Excel,
VBA, PostgreSQL, and R, we endeavor to address pivotal inquiries:

How do annual members and casual riders engage with Cyclistic bikes in distinctive ways?
What notable distinctions exist in usage patterns between these two segments?
What factors prompt casual riders to contemplate the shift towards annual membership?
How can digital media platforms contribute to the conversion of casual riders into 
dedicated, long-term members?

Key Features
Contributions and Future Development
While I am not currently seeking external contributions, I am committed to 
refining and expanding the project based on my personal insights and experiences. 
Future updates may include enhanced visualizations, additional analyses, and deeper 
insights into Cyclistic's marketing strategies.
