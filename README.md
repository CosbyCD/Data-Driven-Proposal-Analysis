GAC_Cyclistic_project

Project Overview
Welcome to the GAC_Cyclistic_project – a project focused on Cyclistic's 
marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. Cyclistic is a 
bike share program in Chicago, boasting a fleet of 5,824 bikes across 692 docking 
stations. With diverse bike categories, styles, and pricing plans, Cyclistic caters 
to a wide range of riders – from leisure cyclists to daily commuters.

This project aims to delve into the behaviors of both annual members and 
casual riders, revealing valuable insights that will inform our strategic 
marketing approaches. Through the analysis of historical bike trip data 
and the utilization of tools such as Excel, VBA, PostgreSQL, and R, we seek
to answer crucial questions:

How do annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic bikes differently?
What are the key distinctions in usage patterns between these two groups?
What motivates casual riders to consider becoming annual members?
How can digital media play a role in converting casual riders into committed members?
